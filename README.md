# New Label Push Notifications Gmail Api Project

A server side Nodejs applications that utilizes Google's Pub/Sub queue system to send notifications whenever a new label is created on a user's Gmail account.

# Why I created this project
I work as a backend enigineer and I am required to write a lot of integration programs to integrate third-party apps into my company's application, much like Zapier. One of the integrations I had to do was to create a program that can receive notifications whenever a Gmail user creates a new label on their mailbox. This event/notification when received can then be used to trigger other automated workflows in our application.

I hope this project helps you out if you have to do something similar.
